# Trampoline Bros!

## Synopsis

Trampoline Bros! is meant to be a 2-player co-op game with a single player option. The goal of the game is to increase your score by performing flips and collecting gold coins. Players are given 3 lives. The player looses life if they perform a flip incorrectly, don't land on their feet, miss the trampoline, or get hit by a varmit. The game is project 1 for my web development immersive program. 

## Motivation

This is my attempt at learning phaser. My goal is to make a version of one of my favorite mobile games for wasting time.

## Installation

- Download the zip 
- Navigate to the Project Directory in your terminal 
- Phaser requires a server to work locally
- start the server from inside the termal and navigate to the port in your browser
- I use python: ** python -m SimpleHTTPServer **.

## Libraries

The only library the game uses is Phaser. No jQuery is required.
